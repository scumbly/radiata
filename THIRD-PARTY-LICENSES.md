# Third-party licenses & attributions

Radiata itself is licensed **GPL-3.0** (see `LICENSE`). This file records the third-party code, data,
reference material, and bundled binaries it incorporates or ships.

---

## 1. NuGet package dependencies (shipped with `Radiata.exe` and its Arcade helper)

All are permissively licensed and GPL-3-compatible. Versions per `ControllerWheel.csproj` and `ArcadeHost/ArcadeHost.csproj`.

| Package | Version | License | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Acornima | 1.7.0 | BSD-3-Clause | JavaScript parser pulled in by Jint (not a direct reference); ships beside `Radiata.ArcadeHost.exe` |
| HidSharp | 2.6.4 | Apache-2.0 | Raw-HID read of the DualSense/DS4 |
| Jint | 4.16.0 | BSD-2-Clause | JavaScript interpreter for drop-in Arcade games — referenced ONLY by `ArcadeHost\` (the sandboxed `Radiata.ArcadeHost.exe`), never by Radiata.exe |
| LiteDB | 4.1.4 | MIT | Reads Playnite's v4 library DB (read-only, raw BsonDocument) |
| MahApps.Metro.IconPacks.Material | 5.0.0 | MIT | The pack wrapper; embeds the Material Design Icons glyph set — see §3 |
| Microsoft.Data.Sqlite | 8.0.18 | MIT | itch butler.db + Battle.net reads (the SQLite engine itself is public domain) |
| NAudio | 2.3.0 | MIT | System volume / audio-endpoint enumeration |
| Nefarius.Drivers.HidHide | 3.4.0 | MIT | Managed client for the HidHide driver |
| Nefarius.ViGEm.Client | 1.21.256 | MIT | Managed client for the ViGEmBus driver |
| SQLitePCLRaw.bundle_e_sqlite3 | 2.1.12 | Apache-2.0 | Native SQLite engine behind Microsoft.Data.Sqlite — pinned explicitly (past GHSA-2m69-gcr7-jv3q; see the csproj note) |
| System.IO.Pipes.AccessControl | 5.0.0 | MIT | ACL on the named pipe between `Radiata.exe` and the Arcade helper (names the helper's AppContainer SID and the current user) |
| System.Security.Cryptography.ProtectedData | 8.0.0 | MIT | DPAPI at-rest encryption of the Discord secret/token |
| System.Speech | 8.0.0 | MIT | Windows SAPI speech for the narration feature |

These packages pull in further libraries that ship with the build under their own licenses: NAudio.*,
Nefarius.Utilities.DeviceManagement, Nefarius.Vicius.Abstractions, Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.Core and
MahApps.Metro.IconPacks.Core (all MIT), SQLitePCLRaw.core, SQLitePCLRaw.provider.e_sqlite3 and
SQLitePCLRaw.lib.e_sqlite3 (Apache-2.0), and Microsoft-authored .NET library packages such as
Microsoft.Extensions.* and System.Text.Json (MIT).

## 2. Bundled driver installers (shipped loose in `drivers\`, run at first-run/OOBE)

Redistributed as-is; each installer carries its own EULA shown during install. Both drivers are by
Nefarius Software Solutions.

| Installer | Version | License | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ViGEmBus | 1.22.0 | BSD-3-Clause | Virtual gamepad bus. RETIRED upstream (archived Nov 2023; 1.22.0 = final, updater-free) |
| HidHide | 1.5.230 | MIT (Nefarius; repo LICENSE) | HID-class cloak filter. (The upstream repo also flags "unknown" on some sub-components; the installer we redistribute is under the repo MIT license.) |
| Legacinator | (bundled) | BSD-3-Clause (Nefarius) | Removes the legacy HidGuardian that can't coexist with HidHide |

## 3. Material Design Icons (glyph data, via MahApps.Metro.IconPacks.Material)

The Button-icons "Best guess"/Xbox tiles and the per-action-type default glyphs render Material Design
Icons geometry. The **MahApps wrapper** is MIT (§1); the **icon set** (Pictogrammers / Material Design
Icons) is **Apache-2.0** (per pictogrammers.com: "free, open-source, and GPL
friendly"). Apache-2.0 asks for attribution + a copy of the license with redistributions: the About-tab
credit plus the full Apache-2.0 text in this file's Appendix satisfies it.

## 4. Sound effects (`Assets\sfx\**\*.wav`)

### 4a. Digital / Physical sets

`slice-armed`, `slice-fired`, `enable-wheels`, `disable-wheels`, `tap`, `selected` — derived from two
sources:

- **OpenGameArt "Zippo click sound"** (dawith, submitted by qubodup) — **CC0** (public domain, no
  attribution). Fully GPL-compatible. https://opengameart.org/content/zippo-click-sound
- **Pixabay "technology-click-0"** (Pixabay Content License) — used as **source material** for a sound
  the author then substantially transformed; the shipped .wav is a derivative work, not the verbatim
  Pixabay file, and ships under Radiata's own GPL-3. Credited here for provenance.
  https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/technology-click-0-513902/

### 4b. Kawaii set (`Assets\sfx\kawaii-*.wav`, `Assets\sfx\xylophone\*.wav`)

The four `kawaii-*.wav` files and the eight C6–C7 xylophone samples that `KawaiiXylophone` sequences derive
from **freesound "Xylophone" by mooncubedesign** — **CC0** (public domain dedication, no attribution
required). Fully GPL-compatible; no redistribution or standalone-use restrictions apply.
https://beta.freesound.org/people/mooncubedesign/sounds/420501/

The shipped WAVs are the author's cut/tuned/normalized derivatives of that source, and ship under Radiata's
own GPL-3.

### 4c. Arcade set (`Assets\sfx\arcade\*.wav`) — licensed, not open

The Arcade games' and launcher's sounds are trimmed, pitched and re-levelled cuts of purchased royalty-free
packs:

- **Tao & Sound** (Fernando del Pueyo Montesinos) — *Buttons SFX Library* and *Puzzle Audio Bundle*, under the
  Tao & Sound licence, https://taoandsound.com/ASEULA.htm. Perpetual per-purchase licence for use "as part of an
  integrated electronic application"; the assets may not be redistributed or made extractable for use outside
  that application; attribution requested where reasonably possible — this entry is that credit.
- **GameDevMarket** RPG Humble Bundle — the *Inventory SFX* and *Magic Spells SFX* bundles, under the GameDevMarket
  asset licence (https://www.gamedevmarket.net/terms-conditions/, multi-project use confirmed by the bundle's
  README). Same posture: embedded use only, no redistribution of the files.

**These files are NOT under the GPL and are NOT in the public source repository.** They ship embedded in
`Radiata.exe` as integrated application assets only. The public repository deliberately omits the folder, the
build compiles without it (an empty resource glob), and a build lacking it simply has a silent Arcade; the
release workflow fetches the folder from a private, secret-gated location at build time.
Anyone building from the public repository must supply their own sounds under these names or accept the silence.

### 4d. Arcade music (`Assets\music\*.m4a`) — Dylan Ribb, CC BY-SA 4.0

The Arcade games' music beds (`ArcadeMusic`; on by default, switched off per game in a game's pause menu) are
by **Dylan Ribb** (https://soundcloud.com/justzerosandones). They are included **with the creator's express
permission**, and are also licensed under **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International**
(CC BY-SA 4.0), https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/.

Tracks: *001 - ARTIFICIAL INCOHERENCE*, *A NEON RAIN THAT NEVER ENDS*, *decoupl.3d*, *Eudaimonia*,
*Eventual Consistency*, *I Miss Toonami*, *P01s0n.p1ll* — © Dylan Ribb.

**Changes:** the shipped `*.m4a` files are re-encoded from the creator's MP3s to mono
AAC at 64 kbps; the music itself is unaltered. The shipped files remain under
CC BY-SA 4.0, not the GPL.

The beds are in the public source repository and embedded in `Radiata.exe`. The build still compiles without
the folder (an empty resource glob) and simply has no music, and the music switch is not offered for a game
whose track is absent.


---

## 5. Trademarks

Steam, Xbox, GOG Galaxy, Ubisoft Connect, Epic Games, Battle.net, itch.io, Playnite, and Discord are
trademarks of their respective owners. Radiata is an independent tool and is not affiliated with, endorsed
by, or sponsored by any of them. Storefront names and the four brand-logo glyphs it displays (Steam, Xbox,
GOG, Ubisoft — Material Design Icons, Apache-2.0) are used **nominatively**, only to identify the storefront
each launcher opens.

Radiata's *own* name and flower mark are trademarks of Jesse Tarter-Holden (né Jesse Holden) and are **not** licensed by the GPL —
see `TRADEMARK.md` and the additional terms at the end of `LICENSE`.

---

## 6. Bundled fonts (`Assets\fonts\*.ttf`)

All three are **SIL Open Font License 1.1**, embedded as WPF resources. OFL permits bundling/redistribution
with software (commercial included) provided the copyright notice and the license accompany it; no font may
be sold by itself. Radiata ships all of them **unmodified** (no subsetting), so the reserved-name clause —
which binds only modified versions — is not engaged either way.

- **Share Tech** — Copyright 2012 The Share Tech Project Authors (post@carrois.com), Reserved Font
  Name "Share". Used for the Reactor material's hub text.
  Source: https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/main/ofl/sharetech
- **Jua** — Copyright 2018 The Jua Project Authors. **No Reserved Font Name is declared.** Used for the Mesa
  material's slice labels. 2.1 MB unsubsetted — the bulk is Hangul coverage Radiata doesn't currently use,
  kept because subsetting would make it a Modified Version and require build-time font tooling the repo has
  no other need for.
  Source: https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/main/ofl/jua
- **Sour Gummy** — Copyright 2018 The Sour Gummy Project Authors
  (https://github.com/eifetx/Sour-Gummy-Fonts). **No Reserved Font Name is declared.** Used for the Kawaii
  material's slice labels, hub text, and preview-tile label. Shipped as the upstream **variable** font
  (`wdth`/`wght` axes) renamed to `SourGummy-Variable.ttf` — renaming the FILE is not a modification of the
  font software; the family name inside it is untouched. Radiata only ever asks for the Regular instance.
  Source: https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/main/ofl/sourgummy

Full OFL-1.1 text: see the Appendix at the bottom of this file (also at https://openfontlicense.org).

---

## 7. Runtime services & curated art references (nothing redistributed)

- **SteamGridDB** — cover art / logos are fetched at runtime with the user's **own** API key, cached
  locally per user, displayed only; Radiata redistributes no art. https://www.steamgriddb.com/terms
- **Steam CDN** — cover art fetched from public storefront endpoints at runtime, display-only, per-user
  cache.
- **Curated art index** (`CuratedArt.g.cs`, `CuratedArtOwner.g.cs`) — checked-in tables of pinned
  SteamGridDB image **URLs** (plus artist display names as shown by SGDB) for well-known titles, used so
  the Picker can offer a good default without an API key. These
  are factual references — no image bytes ship in the repo or the app; each URL resolves to
  community-submitted art hosted by SGDB and is fetched (or not) at runtime on the user's machine under
  the same display-only posture as any other runtime fetch. If SGDB ever objects to hotlink-style
  references, the tables can be regenerated or emptied without code changes elsewhere.
- **Discord** — RPC/OAuth uses the user's **own** Discord application credentials; no secrets ship.

## 8. Code ported from Playnite (MIT)

Three pieces of Radiata's game-library code are ports of code from **Playnite** and
**PlayniteExtensions** by Josef Nemec (MIT), rewritten in Radiata's own shape but derived closely enough
to carry the licence:

- `GameLibrary.ResolveIndirectString` — the MSIX `ms-resource:` display-name resolver, from
  `Playnite/Common/Resources.cs` (`GetIndirectResourceString`).
- `UninstallRegistry` — the uninstall-hive sweep across both hives and both registry views, from
  `Playnite/Common/Programs.cs` (`GetUninstallProgsFromView`).
- The Battle.net product catalog in `GameLibrary` — a data port of `BattleNetGames.cs` from the
  PlayniteExtensions Battle.net plugin, carrying both of Blizzard's id spaces per product.

A few smaller patterns (a tolerant file read, the Epic and Amazon launch-URL shapes) are credited inline
in `GameLibrary.cs` where they are used. The MIT text and copyright line are in the Appendix.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### SIL Open Font License 1.1 — Share Tech, Jua, Sour Gummy (bundled fonts, §7)

```
SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
